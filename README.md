# India Recycles - Website Re-design and Frontend Project

India Recycles is a frontend clone project where I redesigned and replicated the official website of India Recycles. This project is built using Next.js and SCSS for styling. The UI design is entirely crafted by me, and it's still a work in progress, with ongoing improvements and enhancements.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my frontend development skills, including design implementation and responsive web development. By creating a clone of the India Recycles website and redesigning it from scratch, I aimed to showcase my ability to create visually appealing and functional user interfaces.

## Features

- Responsive design: Ensures optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- Next.js: Utilizes the Next.js framework for server-side rendering and efficient routing.
- SCSS: Enhances the styling process with the use of SCSS preprocessor for maintaining organized and reusable styles.
